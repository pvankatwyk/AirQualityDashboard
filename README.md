# AirQualityDashboard
This repository includes a Plotly Dash project for displaying air quality over time. The data was retrieved from Berkeley Earth (berkeleyearth.lbl.gov) and uploaded into a  database instance hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Then, at a fixed interval, a Lambda function is called to periodically update the data from the hourly updating data hosted by Berekely Earth.

For more information on the project or the stack, feel free to reach out to me personally at pvankatwyk@gmail.com.
